  <h2>Project 1</h2>
  <p><strong>Main Objective:</strong> The primary goal of this project was to solidify knowledge and skills in CSS,
    JavaScript, and HTML by creating a Todo Application. The project was designed to be a playground for testing and
    learning new concepts.</p>
  <p><strong>Restrictions:</strong> The project was restricted to not use any Single Page Application (SPA) frameworks
    or any layout/styling frameworks. The aim was to keep the project as "vanilla" as possible, meaning using only plain
    JavaScript, CSS, and HTML without any libraries or frameworks.</p>
  <p><strong>Incentives:</strong> The project was incentivized to use CSS Flexbox and Grid for layout, the
    Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for structuring the JavaScript code, and Template Strings or Handlebars for
    generating HTML. There should also be a simple backend</p>
